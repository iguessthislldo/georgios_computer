Input and Output is handled by the in and out instuction groups

The format is:

`DEVICE SELECTION SOURCE/DESTINATION`

All the arguments are registers for the time being.

For the VM, the all devices at the moment are the C Standard Streams

`in 0 0 %0` reads the content of stdin to general register 0

`out 0 0 %0` writes the content of general register 0 to stdout
